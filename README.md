#### BlueTalk

### Problem Description

The idea came up when I was on a camping trip with a group of friends to Pine Valley, Utah. We were staying in a house with no internet, mobile signals but other kinds of accommodation. I was in the same situation while travelling by airplane or volunteering in the remote areas in Vietnam. Imaging if you come to the trip in the middle of nowhere, or travel in an airplane with your friends or family but you cannot seat near each other, and your phone should be on the airplane mode. Even when you are nearby each other, how do you communicate without annoying or disrupting people around you. Those traveling time will be great experiences if there was a way to keep the communicating between me with the other. This application is proposed to help people to meet the need of communication within the group during their trip to wherever without worrying about internet or mobile signal’s status

### Proposed Solution
Bluetalk provides functions of:
- Turning on and off Bluetooth by asking user for permission
- Paring with other mobile devices via Bluetooth.
- Creating and updating paired devices as friends
- Sending and receiving text messages with individual paired devices.

### Project Status - Building:
I have tried many approaches to get build up this app. However, this is my first time learning Kotlin and it is time consuming to learning how to use, IDE, tools, debug, and other obstacles. Therefore, I have 1 bluetooth app - interacting with other bluetooth device, one is user management app - to later intergrate with bluetooth app to save user info to database, and chat app. I am still working on integrate these app together. Hopefully it will be done soon by the end of the semester.
